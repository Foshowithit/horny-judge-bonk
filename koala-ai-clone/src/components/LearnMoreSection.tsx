          KOALA AI is a fun project on the Solana blockchain. Building a strong community is our goal
          for developing this project, because it is a community token.
        </p>

        <p>
          KOALA AI seeks to encourage and bring new investors to the Solana Blockchain with 0% buy/sell tax.
          We also want to create a safe and secure trading space, so all liquidity will be
          burned once it is added to the contract.
        </p>

        <p>
          We plan to go to the billions!! However, meme tokens have some risks so always DYOR!
